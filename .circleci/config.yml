    # JRuby versions. Specifically:
    #
    #   - JRuby 9.2.x targets Ruby 2.5, and Rubygems 3.3.26 was the last version to
    #     support that
    #   - JRuby 9.3.x targets Ruby 2.6, and version 3.4.22 was the last version to
    #     support that
    #
    # For now, we'll pin to the last supported version. We can drop this check once we
    # drop all those versions of JRuby.
